# When building a docker image, I should always try to keep it as small as possible. So everytime I build an image installing a package, 
# removes the cache to keep it small. The consequence is that you must run apt-get update if you want to install any package.

# COMMANDS:
# apt-get autoclean only removes files that can no longer be downloaded and are virtually useless
# apt-get autoremove removes orphaned packages which are not longer needed from the system, but doesn't purges them. apt-get purge (any configuration files are deleted too)
